## PREMIER LEAGUE FOOTBALL APP 

### AUTHOR: ART ALIU

#### Brief

The brief provided to us for this project sets the following out as its overall objective: "To create a CRUD application with utilisation of supporting tools, methodologies and technologies that encapsulate all core modules covered during training."

I propose to create an app that allows the user to find out information on football players and the clubs they play for in the Premier League. Users will thus be able to input details for the players they choose to know information about including their football team, player age and player number.

The implicit CRUD functionality of this app will include:

CREATE:
- add players
- add football teams

READ:
- view players
- view football teams

UPDATE:
Edit the details of the items in the database

DELETE:
Remove any item from the database

## Planning, Design and Project Tracking

## ERD

I started with a basic entity relationship diagram designed around the relationships I expected these entities to have. My initial design looked like this:

As shown in the ERD, the app models a one to many relationship between the football players and thier football clubs.This allows the user to see the relationship between the two which will show the football clubs having many different players.

## Project Tracking

I used Trello to track the progress of the project as seen with the image below.
The link to the Trello board can found here: https://trello.com/b/JVckaOOB/trello-board

My project board is showing each of the stages of my project. As seen by the above illustration, I have broken it down into six parts:
- Project Resources
- User Stories
- To Do Tasks
- Issues/Risks
- Testing
- Done
Each of these six sections, showing the different elements of the project.

## Front End

The entry point for the app takes you to the home page via a very simple url. The home page directs the user to firstly use the menu option 'Add Football Team' to add a team. The navigation bar was done throught bootstrap.
