## FOOTBALL app 

### AUTHOR: ART ALIU

#### Brief

The brief provided to us for this project sets the following out as its overall objective: "To create a CRUD application with utilisation of supporting tools, methodologies and technologies that encapsulate all core modules covered during training."

I propose to create an app that allows the user to find out information on football players and the clubs they play for in the Premier League. Users will thus be able to input details for the players they choose to know information about including their football team, player age and player number.

The implicit CRUD functionality of this app will include:

CREATE:
- add players
- add football teams

READ:
- view players
- view football teams

UPDATE:
Edit the details of the items in the database

DELETE:
Remove any item from the database
